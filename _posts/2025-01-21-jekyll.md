title: "Jekyll is pretty neat."

I wanted to simplify the way my personal website worked. With a little prior setup, Jekyll is fulfilling my dream of sending Markdown straight to my website. Woop.

## GitHub Pages
Also real slick. No need for a full fat webhost, and it adds version control to everything. Woop. :D

## My Setup
I ended up building my own mini-theme in Jekyll by importing (Bootstrap)[https://getbootstrap.com/]. The default Minima theme looked really promising, but the documentation doesn't match the current release, which makes it needlessly confusing to use. Importing Bootstrap from their CDN should be a more reliable method. This site really doesn't need anything fancy anyway.

## Final Thoughts
The setup was a bit of a pain, but it still beats running Wordpress.
