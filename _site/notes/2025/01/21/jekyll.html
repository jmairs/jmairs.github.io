    <h1>Jekyll is pretty neat</h1>
    <p>21 Jan 2025 - John Mairs</p>
    <p>I wanted to simplify the way my personal website worked. With a little prior setup, Jekyll allows me to write my content in Markdown files and deploy them straight to my website. This saves having to write every page by hand or run an inefficient CMS like Wordpress. Woop.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>I tossed Ruby onto my Mac mini homelab server running Ubuntu and connected to it with VSCode. Then I created a Git repo for my personal GitHub Page and initialized it on the Mac mini. Finally, I added a Gemfile and bundled Jekyll into that directory. The site is built there with Jekyll, then deployed to the web via GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>While I initially wanted to use the default Minima theme that comes with Jekyll, it seems that v3 of this theme still has not been released. Despite that, all the documentation and bugfixes seem to be in this mysterious v3 release that doesn‚Äôt actually exist.</p>

<p>After spending way too much time on that, I just rebuilt my own basic theme by importing <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> from their CDN into my Jekyll layouts. This should be good enough -and- keeps things pretty generic.</p>

<h2 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Also real slick. No need for a full fat webhost, and it adds version control to everything. Double woop. üòÅ</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The setup was a bit of a pain ‚Äî especially given that the default theme is largely unusable - but it still beats running Wordpress.</p>
