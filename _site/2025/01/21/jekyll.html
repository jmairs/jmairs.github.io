    <h1>Jekyll is pretty neat.</h1>
<p>21 Jan 2025 - John Mairs</p>

<p>I wanted to simplify the way my personal website worked. With minimal prior setup, Jekyll is fulfilling my dream of sending Markdown straight to my website. Woop.</p>

<p>Also real slick. No need for a full fat webhost. :D</p>

<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>
<p>I tossed Ruby onto my Mac mini homelab server running Ubuntu. Thatâ€™s acting as my VSCode server. Practically then, I can just fire up VSCode, connect to the Mac mini, update the site content, build with Jekyll, and deploy to Git. Easy enough. Also simple enough to clone the repo elsewhere as needed.</p>
